# multiplication-tables

Hi

In this small project, you just have to give any number as input. After giving in your input, the program finds the multiples of the given number, upto the value 10(ie. 10x). Finally, it calculates the multiples upto 10 and displays the result.

PS: This was done in our school and to store this program in a safe location, I uploaded my code here!
